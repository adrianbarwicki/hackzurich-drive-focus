## Are smart devices smart enough?
Hackzurich project for T-Systems & Zurich Insurance

Smart devices have greatly reshaped our way of living, including mobility. Although they are bringing much convenience and benefits, the associated risks are also increasing: people are driving, walking, cycling, skiing, riding, etc. while being distracted by their smart devices. <br />

Numerous facts support this statement, such as:

Fact 1: 43% of young people have walked into something or someone while checking their phone. In fact, countries are creating “smartphone” walking lanes goo.gl/N0Xt2H<br />

Fact 2: 6 out of 10 car crashes involve distraction, out of which 12% are due to the use of mobile phones goo.gl/jVmPpT<br />
