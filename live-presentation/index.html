											<h2>The Challenge - Are smart devices smart enough?</h2>
											<h4>T-Systems & Zurich Insurance</h4>
										</header>
										
										<div class="detail" style="display: block;">
      <p>Smart devices have greatly reshaped our way of living, including mobility. Although they are bringing much convenience and benefits, the associated risks are also increasing: people are driving, walking, cycling, skiing, riding, etc. while being distracted by their smart devices.<br>
<br>
Numerous facts support this statement, such as:</p>
<p>Fact 1: 43% of young people have walked into something or someone while checking their phone. In fact, countries are creating “smartphone” walking lanes <a href="https://goo.gl/N0Xt2H">goo.gl/N0Xt2H</a></p>
<p>Fact 2: 6 out of 10 car crashes involve distraction, out of which 12% are due to the use of mobile phones <a href="https://goo.gl/jVmPpT">goo.gl/jVmPpT</a><br>
<br>
Zurich’s protection know-how and T-systems’ cloud tools can be combined to find an innovative solution that makes best use of the same technologies that cause the problem. We do therefore challenge you to help us solving this real issue. Help us in promoting save environments by developing:<br>
•   Preventive solutions: “train-the-brain-with-a-game”<br>
•   Solutions while using the device: avoid distraction to occur while driving, cycling, walking, etc.<br>
•   Continuous improvement solutions: reward users for mindful and safe use of smart devices over an extended period of time, including a gamification element<br>
<br>
You will receive our support during the competition.<br>
Specifically, Zurich Insurance can provide you with:<br>
•   The current state and future trends of the mobility journey (e.g. interconnection between different ways of transport, behavioural changes, evolvement of mobility needs, etc.)<br>
•   The relevant insurance know-how (e.g. overview of insurance underwriting process, risk assessment method and data, financial implication for claims, etc.)<br>
T-Systems will provide you with:<br>
•   OpenStack based Cloud Platform (Open Telekom Cloud) providing variety of services from IaaS, PaaS to SaaS. <a href="https://www.open-telekom-cloud.com/">open-telekom-cloud.com</a><br>
•   Pre-built configurations for your projects<br>
•   Our Cloud Platform Experts, Architects and Develops Engineers helping you with your project<br>
<br><br>
We encourage you to participate to address the challenges mobility is currently facing. Be creative in finding solutions to promote safe behaviours and new ideas to embed road-smartness into the future way of mobility. The stage is yours!</p>

									<h2>The Solution</h2>
									
									
									<p style="font-weight: bold;">What it does</p>
<p>SafeDrive detects when you are not paying attention to the rode by analyzing a video feed.</p>

<p style="font-weight: bold;">How we built it</p>
<p>We developed a mobile application that connects to a server build on T-systems infrastructure. Pictures of the front facing camera are sent to our server and from there to the Vision API by Microsoft. The image detection can give us insight into whether the driver is drinking, smoking, sleeping or other things, which then is used to classify if the driver is distracted. This information is sent back to the phone and according to that the driver is notified. Additionally, we implemented a live view that connects to the server, where everyone can check out whats happening.</p>

<p style="font-weight: bold;">Challenges we ran into</p>
<p>The feed of the Vision API is not always classifying the things properly.</p>

<p style="font-weight: bold;">Accomplishments that we're proud of</p>
<p>Through many iterations and many interviews we found a project, which can have an impact on our daily lifes. Furthermore, we found a viable business model that is not only interesting for each driver, but also for large companies. Our working prototype is a first step towards the solution.</p>
